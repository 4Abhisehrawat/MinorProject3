Smart Water Management System (SWMS)
The Smart Water Management System (SWMS) is an innovative solution that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) algorithms to revolutionize water management practices. This system aims to ensure the efficient use of water resources, optimize distribution networks, and maintain water quality standards.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: SWMS continuously monitors water quality and quantity using IoT sensors deployed across various points in the water infrastructure.
Predictive Analytics: AI/ML algorithms analyze data to predict water demand, identify potential issues, and optimize resource allocation.
Water Potability Testing: Integration with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model enables instant classification of water as potable or non-potable based on chemical measurements.
User-friendly Interface: A customizable dashboard provides stakeholders with real-time insights and alerts about water quality, consumption patterns, and system performance.
